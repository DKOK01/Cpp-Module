C++ - Module 07
C++ templates
Summary:
This document contains the exercises of Module 07 from C++ modules.
Version: 10.0


General rules

Compiling

• Compile your code with c++ and the flags -Wall -Wextra -Werror

• Your code should still compile if you add the flag -std=c++98

Formatting and naming conventions

• The exercise directories will be named this way: ex00, ex01, ... , exn

• Name your files, classes, functions, member functions and attributes as required in
the guidelines.

• Write class names in UpperCamelCase format. Files containing class code will
always be named according to the class name. For instance:
ClassName.hpp/ClassName.h, ClassName.cpp, or ClassName.tpp. Then, if you
have a header file containing the definition of a class "BrickWall" standing for a
brick wall, its name will be BrickWall.hpp.

• Unless specified otherwise, every output message must end with a newline character
and be displayed to the standard output.

• Goodbye Norminette! No coding style is enforced in the C++ modules. You can
follow your favorite one. But keep in mind that code your peer evaluators can’t
understand is code they can’t grade. Do your best to write clean and readable code.

Allowed/Forbidden

You are not coding in C anymore. Time to C++! Therefore:

• You are allowed to use almost everything from the standard library. Thus, instead
of sticking to what you already know, it would be smart to use the C++-ish versions
of the C functions you are used to as much as possible.

• However, you can’t use any other external library. It means C++11 (and derived
forms) and Boost libraries are forbidden. The following functions are forbidden
too: *printf(), *alloc() and free(). If you use them, your grade will be 0 and
that’s it.


• Note that unless explicitly stated otherwise, the using namespace <ns_name> and
friend keywords are forbidden. Otherwise, your grade will be -42.

• You are allowed to use the STL only in Modules 08 and 09. That means:
no Containers (vector/list/map, and so forth) and no Algorithms (anything that
requires including the <algorithm> header) until then. Otherwise, your grade will
be -42.

A few design requirements

• Memory leakage occurs in C++ too. When you allocate memory (by using the new
keyword), you must avoid memory leaks.

• From Module 02 to Module 09, your classes must be designed in the Orthodox
Canonical Form, except when explicitly stated otherwise.

• Any function implementation put in a header file (except for function templates)
means 0 to the exercise.

• You should be able to use each of your headers independently from others. Thus,
they must include all the dependencies they need. However, you must avoid the
problem of double inclusion by adding include guards. Otherwise, your grade will
be 0.

Read me

• You can add some additional files if you need to (i.e., to split your code). As these
assignments are not verified by a program, feel free to do so as long as you turn in
the mandatory files.

• Sometimes, the guidelines of an exercise look short but the examples can show
requirements that are not explicitly written in the instructions.

• Read each module completely before starting! Really, do it.
• By Odin, by Thor! Use your brain!!!

Regarding the Makefile for C++ projects, the same rules as in C apply
(see the Norm chapter about the Makefile).

You will have to implement a lot of classes. This can seem tedious,
unless you’re able to script your favorite text editor.

Chapter IV
Exercise 00: Start with a few
functions

Exercise: 00

Start with a few functions
Directory: ex00/
Files to Submit: Makefile, main.cpp, whatever.{h, hpp}
Forbidden: None

Implement the following function templates:

• swap: Swaps the values of two given parameters. Does not return anything.
• min: Compares the two values passed as parameters and returns the smallest one.

If they are equal, it returns the second one.
• max: Compares the two values passed as parameters and returns the greatest one.

If they are equal, it returns the second one.

These functions can be called with any type of argument. The only requirement is
that the two arguments must have the same type and must support all the comparison
operators.

Templates must be defined in the header files.

Running the following code:

int main( void ) {

int a = 2;
int b = 3;

::swap( a, b );
std::cout << "a = " << a << ", b = " << b << std::endl;
std::cout << "min( a, b ) = " << ::min( a, b ) << std::endl;
std::cout << "max( a, b ) = " << ::max( a, b ) << std::endl;

std::string c = "chaine1";
std::string d = "chaine2";

::swap(c, d);
std::cout << "c = " << c << ", d = " << d << std::endl;
std::cout << "min( c, d ) = " << ::min( c, d ) << std::endl;
std::cout << "max( c, d ) = " << ::max( c, d ) << std::endl;

return 0;
}

Should output:

a = 3, b = 2
min(a, b) = 2
max(a, b) = 3
c = chaine2, d = chaine1
min(c, d) = chaine1
max(c, d) = chaine2

Chapter V
Exercise 01: Iter

Exercise: 01

Iter
Directory: ex01/
Files to Submit: Makefile, main.cpp, iter.{h, hpp}
Forbidden: None

Implement a function template iter that takes 3 parameters and returns nothing.

• The first parameter is the address of an array.
• The second one is the length of the array, passed as a const value.
• The third one is a function that will be called on every element of the array.

Submit a main.cpp file that contains your tests. Provide enough code to generate a
test executable.

Your iter function template must work with any type of array. The third parameter
can be an instantiated function template.

The function passed as the third parameter may take its argument by const reference
or non-const reference, depending on the context.

Think carefully about how to support both const and non-const
elements in your iter function.

=====================================================================================

Chapter VI
Exercise 02: Array

Exercise: 02

Array
Directory: ex02/
Files to Submit: Makefile, main.cpp, Array.{h, hpp}
and optional file: Array.tpp
Forbidden: None

Develop a class template Array that contains elements of type T and that implements
the following behavior and functions:

• Construction with no parameter: Creates an empty array.
• Construction with an unsigned int n as a parameter: Creates an array of n elements

initialized by default.
Tip: Try to compile int * a = new int(); then display *a.

• Construction by copy and assignment operator. In both cases, modifying either the
original array or its copy after copying musn’t affect the other array.

• You MUST use the operator new[] to allocate memory. Preventive allocation (al-
locating memory in advance) is forbidden. Your program must never access non-
allocated memory.

• Elements can be accessed through the subscript operator: [ ].
• When accessing an element with the [ ] operator, if its index is out of bounds, an

std::exception is thrown.
• A member function size() that returns the number of elements in the array. This

member function takes no parameters and must not modify the current instance.

As usual, ensure everything works as expected and turn in a main.cpp file that con-
tains your tests.
